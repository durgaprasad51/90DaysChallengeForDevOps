Why This Matters for DevOps
DevOps engineers succeed not just because of tools, but because of:

Discipline
Ownership
Long-term thinking
Ability to execute consistently
In real jobs, no one tells you exactly what to do every day.
This task trains you to take ownership of your own growth, just like a real DevOps engineer.

A clear plan:

Reduces confusion
Prevents burnout
Keeps you focused during tough days
